Authentication is required for API requests, and you need to include the API key header.\n3. The base URL for API endpoints is https://api.example.com/v1.\n4. Use the GET /users endpoint to retrieve a list of users, with optional parameters for pagination.\n5. Use the POST /users endpoint to create a new user, ensuring to include the required fields in the request body.\n6. Error handling is based on standard HTTP status codes, such as 200 OK, 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 404 Found, and 500 Internal Server Error.\n7. There is a rate limiting of 1000 API requests per hour, exceeding which will result in a 429 status code.\n8. Best practices include validating input data, implementing exponential backoff retry logic, caching responses to reduce API calls, and using webhooks instead of polling for smoother integration.",
